# Where Async is Going

Async is still young in Rust, and a moving target. Async traits have been stabilized, with some rough edges. Async closures have landed. There's still more to do, and the ecosystem is still evolving.

Be nice to the async devs. They are working *really hard* to make async in Rust great. And they are doing a fantastic job!
