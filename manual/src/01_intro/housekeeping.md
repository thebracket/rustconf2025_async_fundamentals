# Housekeeping

A few points:

* We'll take breaks every hour or so. More than an hour is hard to focus.
* I'm hard of hearing. My hearing aids are directional. So if you have a question and I don't respond - it's not that I'm ignoring you - I just didn't hear you. Please wave your hand to get my attention.
* Questions are *always* welcome.
